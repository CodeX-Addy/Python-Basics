sort() = updates the list to [1,2,7,8,15,21]
reverse() = updates the list to [15,21,2,7,8,1]
append(8) = adds 8 at the end of the list
insert(3,8) = This will add 8 at 3 index
pop(2) = It will delete the element at index 2 and return its value
remove(21) = It will remove 21 from the last
extend([2,3,4]) - It will extend the existing list as [1,8,7,2,21,15,2,3,4]
clear() - It will clear the entire list
count(1) - It will give the no. of occurences of element
